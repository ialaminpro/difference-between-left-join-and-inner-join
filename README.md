In SQL, `LEFT JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` are two different types of joins used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Hereâ€™s a detailed look at their differences:

### **1. INNER JOIN**

**Definition**: The `INNER JOIN` keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables involved in the join. If there is no match between the tables, those rows will not be included in the result set.

**Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

**Example**:

Assume you have two tables, `employees` and `departments`, with a common column `department_id`.

```sql
-- employees table
| employee_id | name   | department_id |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| 1           | Alice  | 10            |
| 2           | Bob    | 20            |
| 3           | Charlie| 30            |

-- departments table
| department_id | department_name |
|---------------|------------------|
| 10            | HR               |
| 20            | IT               |
| 40            | Finance          |
```

To get a list of employees and their corresponding departments:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

**Result**:

| name   | department_name |
|--------|------------------|
| Alice  | HR               |
| Bob    | IT               |

In this example, Charlie is excluded from the results because there is no matching department with `department_id` 30 in the `departments` table.

### **2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**

**Definition**: The `LEFT JOIN` (or `LEFT OUTER JOIN`) keyword returns all records from the left table (table1) and the matched records from the right table (table2). If there is no match, the result is `NULL` on the side of the right table.

**Syntax**:

```sql
SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;
```

**Example**:

Using the same `employees` and `departments` tables, to get a list of all employees and their departments, including employees who do not belong to any department:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.department_name
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN departments
ON employees.department_id = departments.department_id;
```

**Result**:

| name    | department_name |
|---------|------------------|
| Alice   | HR               |
| Bob     | IT               |
| Charlie | NULL             |

In this result, Charlie is included with `NULL` for `department_name` because there is no corresponding department with `department_id` 30.

### **Summary of Differences**

- **Matching Rows**:
  - `INNER JOIN`: Only includes rows with matching values in both tables.
  - `LEFT JOIN`: Includes all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. Rows from the left table without a match in the right table will have `NULL` values for columns from the right table.

- **Result Set**:
  - `INNER JOIN`: The result set is limited to rows that have matching values in both tables.
  - `LEFT JOIN`: The result set includes all rows from the left table and `NULL` values for columns from the right table where there are no matches.

Choosing between `INNER JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` depends on whether you need to include all rows from the left table regardless of whether there is a match in the right table.
